    "A man stands in front of a tall, ornate mirror with a reflective silver frame, positioned at eye level. His right hand is raised halfway, fingers slightly curled, as if testing the reflection, while his left hand rests at his side. In the mirror, his reflection mirrors his pose exactly, creating perfect symmetry. His head is slightly tilted to the left, and his gaze is fixed on the mirrored version of himself, his eyes sharp and intent. The man\u2019s body faces directly toward the mirror, with his feet placed shoulder-width apart, visible in both the real and reflected image. The background behind him features a dimly lit room with subtle shadows, while the reflection showcases the same room with reversed details, adding a sense of surrealism. The lighting creates a soft glow around the man's face, emphasizing the duality of the real and the mirrored version, with every detail aligned down to the buttons on his shirt and the way his hair falls over his forehead": [
